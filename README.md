# Student presentations

Please push your presentations to this repo as separate sub-directories, indicating the order that you presented, your name, and a v. brief description, all separated by dashes. E.g.: `01-FirstnameLastname-Topic/`.

## R Markdown

Please try to make your presentations using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). You can use any one of the multiple slide deck options. (For what it's worth, I use the [xaringan package with metropolis theme](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes) for my lecture slides). Or you can output as a [GitHub document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html) or [HTML document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html). If you choose the latter, I would request that you please include `keep_md: true` in your YAML, so that it is readable directly on GitHub.

## Topics

Topics will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis. Each person is expected to present twice. Please add your name to the table below (you can [edit this README](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) directly on GitHub) as soon as you have chosen. Note, however, that "open" presentation topics need to be approved first. I've given a list of suggested ideas towards the bottom of this page. I would also prefer that some topics are only presented after specific lectures, but we can discuss that after you chosen.
