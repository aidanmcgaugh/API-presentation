## What is an API

<!-- Apply the CSS classes to specific elements -->
<div class="slide-bg">

  <h2 class="my-heading">API: Application Program Interface</h2>

  <ul>
    <li class="my-bullet">Application is any software that has a specific functionality or purpose</li>
    <li class="my-bullet">Interface is the protocol that dictates how two applications talk to each other using requests and responses</li>
    <li class="my-bullet">API is a way for different systems or applications to communicate with each other</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Why do we need APIs

- Call —> request —> response
- API is a way for an application to communicate with another application without having to understand how the application works or gather data

## How do they work?

- Web APIs deliver client requests and return responses via JSON or XML usually over the internet
- Each request and response cycle is an API call
